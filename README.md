# Demand Forecasting

This project is a part of my industrial project at Celebal Technologies.

### Note:
This [project](https://www.kaggle.com/c/rossmann-store-sales) is not my real work but rather a gist of what I worked on during my internship. The real project is made in Databricks, Azure and Power BI. Due to confidentiality reasons, this has been uploaded.
